  <p>Whenever setting up a new wallet, you will be presented with a 12 or 24 word seed phrase which needs to be written
    down and stored away. More often than not, the seed is simply written down on a piece of paper and stored away
    safely (at least I hope you do that). However, while storing it on paper is the most common form, it certainly isn’t
    the safest. Paper can be easily damaged by the elements, and can suffer from fire or water damage.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had the unfortunate incident of experiencing a house fire, and had to rush to save my seed phrases stored on
    paper. This is where premium seed phrase backup solutions come in. They offer protection against the elements or any
    unfortunate incident. Cryptotag happens to have such an offering, and were kind enough to send us a Cryptotag Zeus
    for review.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Cryptotag Zeus comes in a tightly packed rectangular box. Upon opening it, you will be presented with two
      titanium plates, the center punch in which to enter your seed, a user guide with a BIP 39 word list, two pieces of
      paper to write down your seed, some matches, and also earplugs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"

        style="width: 800px; height: 533px;"></p>
    <p>Upon opening the box, I was trying to figure out the use of the matches and earplugs, so I reached out to Indy
      from Cryptotag. According to him, the matches are to be used to burn the conversion sheets containing the seed
      once it has been punched in on the titanium plates. Meanwhile, the center punch can get quite loud, so the
      earplugs can come in handy. While these two items didn’t have to be included, it is a nice touch from the
      Cryptotag team to have done so.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="design-and-build-quality">Design and Build Quality</h2>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"
        src="//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2992/content_DSC02600.JPG"
        style="width: 800px; height: 533px;"></p>
    <p>The aerospace grade titanium plates are very minimalist in design. The point of the plates is to hold and protect
      your seed, so there isn’t the need to have fancy designs. On the front of each plate, the Cryptotag logo of a
      bull’s head is printed on.</p>
    <p>To keep the two plates together, clamps are provided. These seem to be made out of titanium as well, and are very
      durable to any sort of bending. Now, on the flipside of plates, the most important component can be found - the
      seed storage. The numbers representing the seed phrase are quite small, but at the same time they’re rather easy
      to read. So while the Cryptotag itself has a small footprint, the numbers are still very legible.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When it comes to the numbers on the back, they are quite resistant to scratches from most items. However, if
      scratched with the included center punch, the numbers do start to fade away slightly. It is unlikely though that
      the plates will be subjected to such levels of abuse during regular usage.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-actually-works">How it Actually Works</h2>
    <p>When I first received the Cryptotag, I wondered how it was able to correlate every word out there with certain
      numbers, since there are an estimated <a
        href="https://www.lexico.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language">171,476 words</a> in the
      Oxford English dictionary. That’s when I discovered the BIP39 industry standard.</p>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"
        src="//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2993/content_DSC02577.JPG"
        style="width: 800px; height: 533px;"></p>
    <p>Cryptotag utilizes the BIP39 industry standard when it comes to correlating the numbers to certain words. This
      standard is an alphabetical word list of 2,048 words. Each word in the list has a correlating number, and follows
      alphabetical order. For example, the first word is ‘Abandon’ with the number ‘0001’. Meanwhile, the last number is
      ‘Zoo’ with the number 2,048. Each of these words with their corresponding number is included in the setup guide.
      If you happen to lose the guide, worry not as it can be found online as well.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The BIP39 standard has been adopted by the majority of wallets out there, as well as many protocols. This
      includes blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and many others. Therefore, if you have a seed phrase you
      would like to store in your Cryptotag, it is more than likely that the words correspond to numbers in the BIP39
      list.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="using-the-cryptotag">Using the Cryptotag</h2>
    <p>To get started with the Cryptotag, you will of course need to have a crypto wallet. When creating a wallet, you
      will be presented with a 24 word seed phrase. Write the seed phrase onto the conversion sheet provided by
      Cryptotag.&nbsp;For each word in the phrase, look for the corresponding 4 digit code in the setup guide provided,
      and write it down on the sheet as well. Make sure to triple check the codes as there's no turning back after
      you've punched it in!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once that's&nbsp;done, you can start punching holes onto the titanium plates. Each code contains four numbers, so
      be sure to punch every number in, even any zeros at the start. For example, the corresponding number for ‘Abandon’
      is ‘0001’. Do punch in the three zeros onto the plate, and not just the number ‘1’. This is to avoid any confusion
      when viewing the plate in the future. The end result is you should have two titanium plate backs which look like
      old fashioned punch cards. &nbsp;</p>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"
        src="//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2994/content_DSC02622.JPG"
        style="width: 800px; height: 533px;"></p>
    <p>When using the center punch, hold it at a 90° angle and press down hard. Once you hear a loud ‘bang’, the center
      punch can be removed. We suggest you wear the included earbuds when doing so as the noise it makes is pretty loud.
      After you have completed all the words, discard the sheet with the seed phrase by burning it with the included
      matches.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The whole process of punching in the seed phrase on to the plates took about 15 minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="putting-it-to-the-test">Putting it to the Test</h2>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"
        src="//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2995/content_DSC02652.JPG"
        style="width: 800px; height: 533px;"><br>
      Now that a seed phrase has been etched into the plates, does the Cryptotag actually safeguard it from the
      elements? According to Cryptotag, the titanium plates are rated to stand temperatures up to 1,667 °C (3,032 °F).
      While I don’t own an industrial blow torch, I did test it out under a miniature blow torch.&nbsp;After heating a
      certain part of the plate for a minute or so, the plate was left unscathed. All the torch caused was some slight
      discolouration, with no visible signs of warping.</p>
    <p><img alt="" loading="lazy"
        src="//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/2996/content_20220323_102327.jpg"
        style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"></p>
    <p>When using brute force to bend the plate with a pair of pliers, the plates held their form. Even running over it
      with a car barely left a mark. Only a couple of scuffs were visible after it was subjected to such torture.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>In the video below, we put the Cryptotag through some ardous torture. As can be seen by the end of it, both
      plates were left intact.</p>

    <p>The Cryptotag is an interesting way to store seed phrases. While it can only be used once, and mistakes can’t be
      corrected, it removes the likelihood of jumbling up the seed. This is definitely a premium option for crypto
      owners out there, and the process of setting it up is simple and can be quite enjoyable. If you would like to
      purchase a Cryptotag Zeus for yourself, you may do so <a
